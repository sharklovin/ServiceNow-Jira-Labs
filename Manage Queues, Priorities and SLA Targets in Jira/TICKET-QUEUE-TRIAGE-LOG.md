**SLA:** Time to first response within 8h | Time to resolution within 36h (Apr 17 01:11 PM)
**Assignee:** Nnamso Mkpong

> Awaiting additional information from user before proceeding.

**Customer reply sent:**

> Hi, thank you for your request. To process the software installation, I need the following information: the name and version of the application required, confirmation that this software has been approved by your manager, and the machine name or asset tag of the device it should be installed on. Please reply to this message with these details and I will proceed as soon as I receive them.

**Priority:** Low
**Status:** Resolved
**SLA:** Time to first response within 16h | Time to resolution within 60h (Apr 22 01:12 PM)
**Assignee:** Nnamso Mkpong

**Triage decision:** Low priority — straightforward password reset. No workaround needed for a password reset as the user simply needs their credentials updated. Resolved end to end in a single session. SLA well within target.

**Investigation:**

Opened SUP-11. Confirmed the user's identity via employee ID before performing the reset. Navigated to Active Directory Users and Computers (documented workflow — not available in JSM directly). Reset the password to a temporary value. Enabled the User must change password at next logon option. Confirmed the user logged in successfully with the new temporary password and set their own permanent password.

**Internal note:**

> Issue investigated. Password reset completed. User confirmed working.

**Customer reply:**

> Your password has been reset. Please confirm everything is working correctly.

**Status:** Resolved — Done badge confirmed. SLA met.
